## Contact Link Scraper Bookmarklet

This is a small JavaScript Bookmarklet that, when clicked, goes through all of the links on the current page.
If a link is a :mailto or :tel. It will be stored. After getting the links, a textarea is appended to the middle of the screen, with the data ready to be copied.
If there are no links matching the criteria, the script will redirect to baseURL/contact, so that you can try again there. 

There is a minified script included in this repo, but dont forget to add " javascript: " before saving.
